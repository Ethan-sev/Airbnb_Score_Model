# Airbnb_Score_Model
## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting review scores for Airbnb homes using machine learning and neural networks. By categorizing Airbnb review scores into four distinct groups, we aimed to create models capable of making accurate predictions based on the data. 

The dataset used is unbalanced, which presented a significant challenge throughout the project. Addressing this imbalance was crucial to improving the model's performance. Neural networks proved particularly effective in predicting lower review scores by allowing us to weight each category differently. However, this approach also introduced certain drawbacks.

For those interested in undertaking a similar project, we recommend considering a traditional regression model using the original data format for the target variable. While our project achieved good accuracy and provides a solid framework for tackling this type of analysis, it still has room for improvement in certain areas.

## Summary

In this project, we successfully predicted Airbnb review scores by applying various machine learning techniques, including neural networks. By categorizing review scores into four distinct groups, we managed to address the challenges posed by an unbalanced dataset. The use of neural networks allowed us to weight each category differently, improving the model's ability to predict lower review scores, though it did come with trade-offs.

While our approach yielded good accuracy, we identified potential areas for further improvement. Future work could explore alternative models, such as traditional regression, using the original data format for the target variable. Overall, this project serves as a strong foundation for predicting review scores and offers insights into handling unbalanced datasets in machine learning.
