# Airbnb_Score_Model
## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting review scores for Airbnb homes using machine learning and neural networks. By categorizing Airbnb review scores into four distinct groups, we aimed to create models capable of making accurate predictions based on the data. 

The dataset used is unbalanced, which presented a significant challenge throughout the project. Addressing this imbalance was crucial to improving the model's performance. Neural networks proved particularly effective in predicting lower review scores by allowing us to weight each category differently. However, this approach also introduced certain drawbacks.

For those interested in undertaking a similar project, we recommend considering a traditional regression model using the original data format for the target variable. While our project achieved good accuracy and provides a solid framework for tackling this type of analysis, it still has room for improvement in certain areas.
